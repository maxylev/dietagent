## üîå API Integration

Diet Agent uses the Browser-Use Cloud API to access real-time supermarket data. Here's how it's integrated:

### Browser-Use Service

The application uses a dedicated service to interact with the Browser-Use API:

```typescript
// Example of how the Browser-Use service is used
const service = new BrowserUseService(apiKey);
const task = await service.runMealPlanTask(userQuery, preferences);
const result = await service.waitForTaskCompletion(task.id);
```

### API Key Management

- API keys are securely stored in the browser's localStorage.
- The application validates API keys before use and provides feedback on key status.
- Users can update or change their API key in the settings.

### Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for API interactions:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback options when API calls fail
